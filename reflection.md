- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

Inheritance helps me program more efficiently by avoiding unnecessary repetition. Without using inheritance in this assignment, I would've had to individually create the name, address, and nFloors attributes for each class and assign them in the constructors, but inheritance makes it possible to only do that step once.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment mostly worked well for me. Getting started on it in class was very helpful. The main challenge was knowing that we will expand on this assignment next week, but not knowing exactly what we'll do with it. This made me unsure if certain choices I made would be the best going forward - for instance, when to throw exceptions, and how to restock the cafe. My advice to future students is to think about real-life comparisons and try to model the code on real life as much as possible.
